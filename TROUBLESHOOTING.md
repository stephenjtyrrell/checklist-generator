# OpenRouter Model Testing

## Issue Analysis
All fallback models are failing, which suggests:

1. **Model Availability**: The models in the fallback list may not be available on OpenRouter
2. **API Key Issues**: The API key might not have access to free models
3. **Rate Limiting**: All models might be rate limited simultaneously
4. **Request Format**: There might be an issue with the request format

## Updated Fallback Models
I've updated the fallback models to use more commonly available free models on OpenRouter:

```csharp
private readonly string[] _fallbackModels = new[]
{
    "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free",
    "openchat/openchat-7b:free", 
    "huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta:free",
    "google/gemma-7b-it:free",
    "meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct:free"
};
```

## Enhanced Error Handling
1. **Better Logging**: Added more detailed logging to understand what's failing
2. **Faster Failover**: Reduced delay from 5 seconds to 2 seconds for rate limits
3. **Model Availability Check**: Added specific handling for model not found errors
4. **Basic Fallback**: Added a non-AI fallback that extracts basic items from document

## Basic Fallback Mode
When all AI models fail, the service now:
1. Creates a notice that AI is unavailable
2. Extracts the first 10 meaningful lines from the document
3. Creates basic checklist items for manual review
4. Ensures the application remains functional

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check OpenRouter API Key
```bash
# Verify your API key is set
dotnet user-secrets list
```

### 2. Test with a Simple Model
Try setting a single reliable model:
```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenRouterModel" "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free"
```

### 3. Check OpenRouter Dashboard
- Visit https://openrouter.ai/activity
- Check your usage and credits
- Verify which models you have access to

### 4. Alternative Free Models to Try
If the current models don't work, try these:
- `meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct:free`
- `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free`
- `google/gemma-2b-it:free`

### 5. Paid Model Option
If free models continue to fail, consider a low-cost paid model:
```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenRouterModel" "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Try Primary Model**: Attempts your configured model first
2. **Fallback Sequence**: Tries each fallback model in order
3. **Basic Processing**: If all AI fails, provides basic document parsing
4. **Graceful Error**: Always returns something useful, never crashes

The application should now remain functional even when all AI models are unavailable, providing a basic fallback that extracts document content into checklist items for manual review.
